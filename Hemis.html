    <center><p>Have you ever come across snow leopards? Well, Ladakh's Hemis National
        Park is considered to be the capital of Snow Leopard of India. What
        makes this national park exceptional is the fact that aside from inhabiting
        the famed snow leopard, it is also the only national park in the northern
        regions of the Himalayas. These cute snow leopards are begging you to visit this
        place. <a href="choose.html">Back page</a></p>
