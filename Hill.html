    <center><p>Just as the name goes, the Magnetic hill is actually a gravity hill
        which possess impeccable magnetic properties. Do not be alarmed by
        the sudden movement of your vehicles in neutral going uphill as the
        magnetic field will make it happen. In fact, to avoid being sucked
        in the magnetic field of the hill, airplanes often take their
        altitudes up a notch. This is a link to a video of a car being lifted
        to the top in neutral gear https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL22JramBbQ
