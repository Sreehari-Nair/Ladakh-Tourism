        <p>Rent a Himalayan and go nuts on the road to Khardung-la pass. The pass is a 
           gateway to the Nubra as well as Shyok valley and is one of the most elevated
           motorable terrains worldwide. Interestingly, the roads were opened in 1988 for
           vehicles to pass through. Cruisers and Himalayans considered to be the best
           means to travel here, to experience the rugged beauty of the journey. Honestly,
           I will feel quite an adventurer if I was standing that high. <a href="choose.html">Back page</a></p>
