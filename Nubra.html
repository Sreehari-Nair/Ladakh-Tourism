        <p>Famous for its white sand deserts and double-humped camels, Nubra Valley is
           certainly one of the best places to visit in Ladakh. Not just the scenic
           slopes of Karakoram range but also the confluence of Shyak and Siachen
           rivers is what makes Nubra valley an exquisite voyage! I mean seriously,
           there is something wrong with you if you decide not to visit this page 
           I mean look at the picture!
